# DSA210-Term-Project-Fall-2024

## Dataset Description
This project uses a dataset of university emails collected from Google Takeout and Thunderbird. The dataset contains information such as:
- Email timestamps
- Sender details
- Subject lines (optional for analysis)

The goal is to analyze these emails to extract patterns and insights, such as the most frequent time of day emails are received and the busiest weeks in a semester for email activity.

---

## Project Idea
The purpose of this project is to analyze university emails and provide insights such as:
- **Best time of day** to check emails
- **Most frequent senders** of emails
- **Peak weeks** in a semester for receiving emails

These insights can help students manage their inboxes effectively and reduce email-related stress by identifying patterns.

## Plan
1. **Data Extraction**  
   Use Python to extract email data from text files exported via Google Takeout and Thunderbird.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Process the data to extract relevant fields such as timestamps and sender information.

3. **Data Analysis**  
   Use Python libraries like Pandas to:
   - Analyze the frequency of emails by time of day
   - Identify the busiest weeks in the semester
   - Find the most frequent senders

4. **Data Visualization**  
   Create plots (e.g., bar charts, line graphs) using Matplotlib or Seaborn to visualize findings.

## Predictions
1. The most emails are received between **12:00 PM and 2:00 PM**.
2. The busiest weeks for email activity are between **Week 7 and Week 10** of the semester.

## Audience
This project is designed for university students who want to:
- Understand when they are most likely to receive emails
- Plan the best times to check their inbox
- Prepare for the busiest times of the semester when email activity peaks
